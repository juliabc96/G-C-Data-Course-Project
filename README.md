# G-C-Data-Course-Project
Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project.

This is my submission for the "Getting and Clenaing Data" Course Project.
You can find:
1. Codebook, in which all the steps taken regarding the variables, the data and its transformation are described
2. run_analysis.R, which performs all the steps described on the codebook (merging of the data sets, extracting the measurements on the mean and standard deviation, descriptive activity names, etc.)
3. ctdata.txt, which is the final exported data.
