Step 1. Downloading and loading the datasets

The datasets were downloaded and extracted from the folder UCI HAR Datase (link: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

The following variables were loaded:
    a) features (features.txt)
              561 rows, 2 columns
    b) activities (activity_label.txt)
              6 rows, 2 columns
    c) subject_test (test/subject_test.txt)
              2947 rows, 1 column
    d) x_test (test/X_test.txt)
              2947 rows, 561 columns
    e) y_test (test/y_test.txt)
              2947 rows, 1 column
    f) subject_train (train/subject_train.txt)
              7352 rows, 1 column
    g) x_train (train/X_train.txt)
              7352 rows, 561 columns
    h) y_train (train/y_train.txt)
              7352 rows, 1 column

Step 2. Combining/merging the datasets

  2.1. Create 'x' by merging 'x_test' and 'x_train'.
        rbind(x_train, x_test)
  2.2. Create 'y' by merging 'y_test' and 'y_train'.
        rbind(y_train, y_test)
  2.3. Create 'subject' by merging 'subject_train' and 'subject_test'.
        rbind(subject_train, subject_test)
  2.4. Subsequently create 'mergeddata' by merging 'subject','x' and 'y'.
        cbind(subject, y, x)

Step 3. Cleaning the data
  3.1. Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
Create 'cleand' by subsetting 'mergeddata', selecting the columns 'subject' and 'code' and measurements 'mean' and 'std' (standard deviation).
                               
  3.2. Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the dataset
Now using 'cleand', replace numbers in 'code' with the corresponding activity from the 'activities' variable.

  3.3. Appropriate labels for the dataset with descriptive variable names
Rename the column'code' into 'activities'. Then rename the following:
-'Acc' replaced by 'Accelerometer'
-'Gyro' replaced by 'Gyroscope'
-'BodyBody' replaced by 'Body'
-'Mad' replaced by 'Magnitude'
-'f' replaced by 'Frequency'
-'t' replaced by 'Time'

Step 4. Creating a second, independent tidy data
  This means a set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
  This new dataset is created by sumarizing 'cleand'. This means grouping by subject and activity, and then taking the means of each variable for each activity and subject.
  Finally, export the final data into a text file: 'ctdata.txt'
